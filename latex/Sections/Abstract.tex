Feature selection has been studied and shown to improve performance in standard batch data mining but is mostly unexplored in data stream mining. The flowing and potentially infinite nature of data streams demand that algorithms in a stream setting be efficient, constrained in memory usage, and incremental. Algorithms must also be able to cope with changes in the stream's distributions which can occur at any time. Our project explores subsetting as a method of feature selection in a stream setting and investigates its effectiveness in addressing the aforementioned problems. We propose a new method of embedded feature subset selection specialised for kNN classification in a stream setting based called Iterative Subset Selection (ISS) which splits the feature selection into two stages, first ranking the features, then iteratively selecting features from the ranking. We implement and test the method against a variety of datasets and from our results we conclude that the proposed feature selection method does improve overall classifier performance.
