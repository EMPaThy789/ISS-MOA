I would like to express my gratitude to all my friends for their support. I give a special thanks Jeff Mo for his help, advice, and feedback, always being someone of whom I can bounce ideas off of. I also give special thanks to Antonia McGhie for giving many hours of her free time to help me with proofreading, and Bob Lu for also spending his personal time to help with proofreading.

A special mention and gratitude to my mum for providing me with copious amounts of food.

I would also like to acknowledge and thank Jean-Paul Barddal, for providing me with implementations of PiD and DFW.

Last but not least, many thanks go to my supervisor Bernhard for his help, guidance, and encouragement throughout the project.
